        2. Your name should now be in front of the repo name before the slash and below that should say where you forked it from
        3. Add your TL as a collaborator on your forked Repo
        4. Clone your Repo using githubs "Clone or download" button
        5. In Terminal, use the cd command to go to the directory where you are going to want to clone your forked Repo
        6. Use the git clone <link-to-repo> command to clone the repo to the directory you are currently in
        7. cd into the newly created repo using the cd <repo-name> command
        8. Use the git checkout -b 'firstname-lastname' command to create your own branch name for the repo
        9. Now work on your Repo and complete the project assignment
        10. Add and commit changes to your branch
            Add - git add . 
            Commit - git commit -m "Your helpful commit message here"
        11. Push your changes back up to your Github Repo
            Push - git push -u origin branch-name
        12. Now that the changes are on GitHub you can submit a Pull Request
        13. Go back to your forked Project repo on github (make sure you are on YOUR FORKED copy NOT the original Lambda one).
